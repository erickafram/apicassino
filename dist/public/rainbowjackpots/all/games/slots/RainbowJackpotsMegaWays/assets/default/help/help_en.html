<h2>SPECIAL SYMBOLS AND FEATURES</h2>

<h3>MEGAWAYS™</h3>
<p>The number of possible win ways varies per spin according to the total number of individual symbols which land on the reels. Up to 7 symbols may land on each of the 6 reels, giving a maximum potential 117,649 MegaWays™ to win!</p>

<h3>CHAIN REACTION</h3>
<p>Symbols forming wins disappear, making way for new symbols to drop in that may form new wins.</p>

<h3>LUCKY LEPRECHAUN FEATURES</h3>
<p>The Lucky Leprechaun may randomly appear during a spin and blow his Lucky Pipe to trigger one of the following features: RANDOM TILES, MEGA RANDOM TILES, FREE SPINS, MEGA FREE SPINS, BEER BONUS, MEGA BEER BONUS, FAIRY BONUS or MEGA FAIRY BONUS.</p>

<h3>WILD</h3>
<p>The WILD can land on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 only. The WILD substitutes for all paying symbols and counts as the symbol which forms the highest winning combination on a single win way.</p>

<h3>RANDOM TILES</h3>
<p>When blowing his Lucky Pipe, the Lucky Leprechaun may reveal a WILD symbol or any other paying symbol excluding royals. When this happens, 3 or more couples of this symbol type will rain down and land on the reels from left to right. The paying symbols start landing from the leftmost reel, while WILDS start landing from the second reel.</p>
<p>The Lucky Pipe may also reveal a MEGA version of these tiles. When this happens, 3 or more MEGA RANDOM TILES, covering an entire reel, will rain down and land on the reels in the same way as the regular RANDOM TILES. These MEGA RANDOM TILES hold a symbol MULTIPLIER of between x2 and x7. They count for as many symbols as the symbol MULTIPLIER displayed when participating in a win way.</p>

<h3>BEER BONUS</h3>
<p>Landing 3 or 4 BEER BONUS scatters on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 triggers the BEER BONUS  or the MEGA BEER BONUS respectively. Alternatively, when blowing his Lucky Pipe, the Lucky Leprechaun may reveal 3 or 4 BEER BONUS scatters triggering the respective bonus round.</p>
<p>At the start of the bonus rounds, 4 beer taps will appear on top of the middle reels. When the regular BEER BONUS is triggered the player has to pick one of the taps to be awarded its prize. When the MEGA BEER BONUS is triggered all 4 taps are awarded, without picking.</p>
<p>The beer taps will then pour beer into the glasses on the reels, creating a random INSTANT CASH PRIZE in each glass. In the regular BEER BONUS only, the award from the picked tap is won, while in the MEGA BEER BONUS all 4 taps award their prize.</p>
<p>The cash prizes represent a stake MULTIPLIER. The possible MULTIPLIERS in the regular BEER BONUS are 10x, 15x, 20x, 25x, 30x, 40x, 50x or 60x the current stake, while in the MEGA BEER BONUS the possible MULTIPLIERS are 50x, 60x, 70x, 80x, 90x, 100x, 150x, 200x, 250x, 300x, 400x, 500x or 1000x the current stake in total from all the glasses.</p>

<h3>FAIRY BONUS</h3>
<p>3 or more FAIRY BONUS scatters landing anywhere on the reels trigger the FAIRY BONUS. Alternatively, when blowing his Lucky Pipe, the Lucky Leprechaun may reveal 3 or 4 FAIRY BONUS scatters triggering the bonus round.</p>
<p>The FAIRY BONUS features 6 levels. The player starts from level 1. Landing 4, 5 or 6 FAIRY BONUS scatters guarantees that level 2, 3 or 4 of the bonus will be reached respectively.</p>
<p>Each level of the FAIRY BONUS has 6 crystals to pick from. Picking a crystal reveals an INSTANT CASH PRIZE, representing a stake MULTIPLIER. 2 of the crystals on level 1 and 1 of the crystals on levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 may also reveal a level up arrow in addition to the cash prize. Revealing a level up arrow awards 1 more pick at the next level of the bonus.</p>
